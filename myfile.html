  The internet backbone is multiple companies that own numerous 
networks.

A client is a program that makes requests to a server. A server is a program that fulfills those requests.

Switches connect devices that share a single network. They use packet switching to forward packets to the correct devices.

The TCP/IP is a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols used in the Internet.

Web, file, and mail servers.

Hypertext is text displayed on electronic devices with hyperlinks.

The Internet is a global network of networks while the Web, also referred to formally as World Wide Web (www) is a collection of information that is accessed via the Internet.

A client sends an HTTP request to a server, specifying the desired action, such as retrieving a web page or submitting form data.

HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses, and to digitally sign those requests and responses. 

Web 1.0 refers to the original, information-oriented version of the World Wide Web. Web 2.0 describes the current state of the internet, which has more user-generated content and usability for end-users compared to its earlier incarnation, Web 1.0. Web 3.0 is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a decentralized network and have access to their own data.

The similarity between them is that all three versions allow the free dissemination of information across a large audience. The difference between them is that Web 1.0 is the "read-only Web," Web 2.0 is the "participative social Web," and Web 3.0 is the "read, write, execute Web."

Markup languages are the building blocks used to create web pages or all shapes and sizes. 

Markup languages are used to structure and format text and other content on a webpage. Programming languages are used to create software applications and operating systems. Scripting languages are used to automate tasks and add functionality to applications.

(HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.) HTML and XML are both descendants of an earlier markup language called SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). SGML is a complicated set of rules that define document structures. XML is a subset of SGML that does the same thing, using fewer rules.

My interests are video games, sports and working out.

This class will help me learn more about coding and computing science in the future.
